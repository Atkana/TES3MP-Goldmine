# TES3MP-Roleplay
An archive of lua based scripts for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Multiplayer (TES3MP) to fit an enjoyable roleplaying experience, these are open source and shall be treated like such, enjoy!

The ZIP folder should have everything you need, credit should be in corresponding files. Personal thank you to David C. (making this all possible), David-AW (making RP possible), Flutters and Nacalal of FTC for keeping it going so long, User Erik, and User Atkana for helping flesh out the resh of the visuals of the chatbox for immersion.
