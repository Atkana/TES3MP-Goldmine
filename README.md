# TES3MP-Goldmine
An archive of lua based scripts for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Multiplayer (TES3MP) to fit an enjoyable experience for all.

The ZIP folder should have everything you need, credit should be in corresponding files. Personal thank you to David C. (making this all possible), David-AW (making RP possible), Texafornian (making completely amazing scripts to better and diverse our experiences!)
