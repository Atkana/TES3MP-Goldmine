# TES3MP-Goldmine
An archive of lua based scripts for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Multiplayer (TES3MP) to fit an enjoyable experience for all.
These are open source and shall be treated like such, enjoy!

The ZIP folder should have everything you need, credit should be in corresponding files. Personal thank you to David C. (making this all possible), David-AW (making RP possible), Texafornian (making completely amazing scripts to better and diverse our experiences!), Reinhart XIV (making alchemy somewhat possible pre-enchant/alchemy/spellmaking release!)

If you would like to submit any files that can be added to this Goldmine, please message me on steam, gmail, or discord!
